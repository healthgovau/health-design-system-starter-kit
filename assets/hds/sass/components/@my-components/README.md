# My components

Place any new components that are specific to your application in this folder. Copy to SASS partial and components structure seen in the `@health` folder.

## Example

If you want to build a new widget, then you should:

* Create a `_widget.scss` file in this folder.
* Make sure that the partial file is imported into  `@my-components/_components.scss`
* Uncomment **//@import '@my-components/components';** in `components/_components.scss`
