    <briefsummary>This is a study to characterise the effects of a Moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Inhibitor on the
      impact of Bomedemstat (IMG-7289) in healthy volunteers. IMG-7289 may be indicated for use in patients with cancer.
      A drug-drug interaction trial is needed to better understand how the body interacts with administered drugs
      throughout the entire duration of drug exposure.

      Who is it for?

      You may be eligible for this study if you are aged 18 to 65 years and are in good general health without a
      clinically significant medical history. People who have been diagnosed with cancer will not be eligible for this
      study.

      Study details

      This trial will take place over 73 days, where participants will be screened for 28 days, receive oral medication
      over a 13-day period, and will then be followed up. All participants will have their vital signs checked (heart
      rate, blood pressure, temperature, etc), and will provide blood and urine samples for testing.

      It is hoped this research will determine whether Moderate CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein Inhibitor have an effect on
      the reaction of volunteers to Bomedemstat (IMG-7289). Healthy participants in the current study will not receive
      any health benefit (beyond that of an assessment of their medical status) from participating in the study;
      however, data from this study will support the potential development of bomedemstat.</briefsummary>
    <inclusivecriteria>1. Must have given written informed consent before any study related activities are carried out
      and must be able to understand the full nature and purpose of the trial, including possible risks and adverse
      effects.
      2. Adult males and females, 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive) at Screening Visit.
      3. Body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 18.0 and less than or equal to 32.0 kg/m2, with a body weight
      greater than or equal to 55 and less than or equal to 100 kg at Screening Visit.
      4. Be non-smokers (including tobacco, e-cigarettes or other nicotine containing products, and marijuana) for at
      least 1 month prior to first study drug administration and have a negative result of cotinine test at screening
      and on Day -1. In the event the cotinine test is positive, the test may be repeated once (at the discretion of the
      PI) to confirm eligibility.
      5. No prior history of chronic alcohol abuse or excessive alcohol intake, at the discretion of the PI, within 12
      weeks prior to screening. No alcohol is to be consumed for at least 48 hours prior to admission, with negative
      alcohol test results (at screening and on Day -1). In the event the alcohol breath test is positive, the test may
      be repeated once (at the discretion of the PI) to confirm eligibility. Excessive alcohol intake is defined as
      regular consumption of >12 standard units of alcohol per week, or more than 4 standard drinks on >3 days per week,
      where 1 standard drink is 10 g of pure alcohol and is equivalent to 285 mL beer [4.9% Alc./Vol], 100 mL wine [12%
      Alc./Vol], 30 mL spirit [40% Alc./Vol]).
      6. No prior history of substance abuse or drug addiction within 12 months prior to first study drug administration
      and negative urine drug screen results at screening and on Day -1. In the event the urinary drug test is positive,
      the test may be repeated once (at the discretion of the PI) to confirm eligibility.
      7. No prior history of relevant drug hypersensitivity.
      8. Medically healthy (in the opinion of the PI) as determined by pre-study medical history and without CS
      abnormalities at screening, and after check-in on Day -1, and prior to first dose administration on Day 1,
      including:
      a. Physical examination without any clinically relevant findings;
      b. Systolic blood pressure in the range of 100 to 160 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure in the range of 50 to 95
      mmHg after 5 minutes in supine position;
      c. Pulse rate (PR) in the range of 50 to 100 beats/minute after 5 minutes rest in supine position;
      d. Body temperature (tympanic), between 35.5°C and 37.7°C;
      e. A 12-lead ECG within normal range (QTcF males less than or equal to 450 ms; QTcF females less than or equal to
      470 ms) or with abnormalities that are not hazardous to the participant according to the opinion of the PI;
      f. No clinically relevant findings in clinical laboratory blood and urinalysis tests as judged by the PI;
      g. ALT/AST less than or equal to 1.5 ULN, total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 x ULN and/or creatinine
      clearance greater than or equal to 80mL/min (calculated using Cockcroft &amp; Gault formula).
      NOTE: Laboratory results obtained during screening and prior to first dose administration on Day 1 should be used
      to determine eligibility criteria. In situations where laboratory results, vitals or ECGs are outside the
      permitted range, the Investigator may retest the participant once and the subsequent within range screening result
      may be used to determine the participant’s eligibility.
      9. Participants with a history of Hepatitis B or C are eligible on the condition that participants have adequate
      liver function as defined by Inclusion Criterion #8 and are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative and/or
      have undetectable hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA.
      10. Female participants must:
      a. Be of nonchildbearing potential i.e., surgically sterilised (hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral
      oophorectomy at least 6 months prior to dosing) or post-menopausal (where post-menopausal is defined as no menses
      for 12 months without an alternative medical cause, and a follicle-stimulating hormone level >40 IU/L at the
      Screening Visit), or
      b. If of child-bearing potential, must have a negative serum pregnancy test at screening and before the first
      study drug administration (Day -1, urine test). They must agree not to attempt to become pregnant, must not donate
      ova, and must use a highly effective contraceptive method from signing the consent form until at least 30 days
      after the last dose of study drug.
      c. Must not be breast-feeding.
      11. Male participants, if not surgically sterilised, must be willing not to donate sperm and, if engaging in
      sexual intercourse with a female partner who could become pregnant, must be willing to use a condom in addition to
      having the female partner use a highly effective contraceptive method from signing the consent form until at least
      30 days after the last dose of study drug. Note that oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception
      must be established in the female partner who could become pregnant, and in use for at least a month prior to
      screening.
      12. Have suitable venous access for blood sampling.
      13. Be willing and able to comply with all study assessments and adhere to the protocol schedule and restrictions.
